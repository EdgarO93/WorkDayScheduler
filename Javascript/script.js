//define variables
var today= moment().format("MMMM D, YYYY");
// probrably add variables to each hour to maybe make each a form?

// Date Set (month number, year), Could maybe add time
$("#currentDay").text(" Today is  " + today);



//need to figure out how to compare string value to time
//function to change the color based on time, maybe some kind of conditional statment
// to check time (if current time < time make red, else if turn current time >time green else nothing)
//color could be done by assigned an id or class and then using css to change color 

//function changeColor(){ }


//function to save each input and add to local storage

//click event for save button
$(safeBtn).on("click", function () {
  //function for saving list
    
});
